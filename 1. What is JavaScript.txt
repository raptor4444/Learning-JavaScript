Q. What are the things that a front end of a website consists of?


	obviously we know all the answer. 
	the major components of front end is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

	so why do we need three?
	
	- well it creates microservices for the website to render the components easily. 
	- each component is used and perform its own task.



	HTML creates structure, paragraphs and headings and so on.

	CSS tells the browser how things look.


	Now the JAVASCRIPT :

	Javascript is a scripting language of the web.

	A scripting language or script language is a programming language that is used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an
	existing system. Scripting languages are usually interpreted at runtime rather than compiled. ~ Wiki


	JavaScript adds interactivity, multi-media control and more.

	Increasingly html and css both are capable of doing the same too and even with less fragility.

	But for the most of the dynamic and interactive features of the web we need JavaScript.
