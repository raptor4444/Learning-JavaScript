    // Back in time we used "var" to define variables in javascript.

    // BUT Now we use "const" and "let".

    let apple = 'tasty';

    /*
    "let" is used to initialize the variable with a non-fixed value, 
    ie., it is possible to change the value afterwords.
    */

    const mango = 'scrumptious';

    /*
    now the variable mango is initialized using "const",
    hence this defines that the value of variable will not be reinitialized.
